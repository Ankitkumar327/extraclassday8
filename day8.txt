Box Shadow, Text Shadow Transition and Transformation

Box-Shadow and text-shadow accepts h-offset, v-offset, blur, spread-radius, color.

when we provide value to v-offset, then it moves horizontally to the right side of screen.
when we provide value to h-offset, then it moves vertically to downside of the screen.
when we provide value to blur, then it provides a blur background behind the box.
when we provide value to spread-radius, then it increase the height and width of background blur.
when we provide value of color, then the background color will be the color which we have provided.

Transition: Transition property, Transition duration, transition timing function, transition delay
For adding multiple properties, we have to seperate them by commas.

ease-> slow start and then fast and end slowly
ease-in-> start slow
ease-out-> end slow
